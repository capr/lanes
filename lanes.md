**NOTE: This is just a distribution of Lanes. Lanes is developed [here][lanes site].**

### Documentation

There's up-to-date Lanes documentation [here][lanes doc]. Ignore the [old site].

### LuaJIT notes

  * to use ffi inside lanes you have to require the ffi module inside the lane, since the ffi module cannot
    be transferred as an upvalue to your lane (you will get an error about "destination transfer database").
    * this also means that *other modules* that depend on ffi cannot be upvalues and must be required
	   explicitly inside the lane or luajit will crash.
